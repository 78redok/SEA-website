# SEA-website

This is a website I made specifically for the SEA program, however I do anticipate that I will be using it for my personal page in the future.
While I'm still new to javascript, html and css, I'm a fast learner, and I put together this website in about 25 hours of learning.

Features:
links
buttons
alert to download
sample e-commerce page(working on checkout, will not be functional)
"responsiveness"
hamburger menu,
etc.
