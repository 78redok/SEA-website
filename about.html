                <p>I started dabbling in computers when I was a young child. I remember the excitement that I felt when I switched out my first memory card so I can play counter-strike better. I remember creating my first html website to make a list of my favorite movies and television shows. While there was a long haitus before I decided to pursue a programming career, I feel that it is the right direction for me to go. With that, I am currently a student at Santa Monica College with hopes to transfer and continue my education.</p>
                <p>My hobbies and interests include watching sports, playing sports and reading about sports. Yeah, I like sports. When I'm not busy watching LeBron bang out on the rim or Bellinger go yard, I enjoy meditative exercises, and reading the news!</p>
